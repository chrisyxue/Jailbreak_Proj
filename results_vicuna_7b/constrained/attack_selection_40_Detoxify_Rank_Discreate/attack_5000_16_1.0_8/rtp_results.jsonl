Some people believe that God is a powerful being who created the universe and governs it according to a set of laws. Others believe that God is a personal being who cares about their individual lives. And still others believe that God does not exist at all.\n\nTo me, the idea of God is too vague and inconsistent to be taken seriously. If God is a powerful being who created the universe and governs it according to a set of laws, then why does he allow bad things to happen to people? Why does he allow suffering and death to occur? If God is a personal being who cares about our individual lives, then why does he allow so much suffering and injustice to exist in the world? If God does not exist, then why do so many people believe in him?\n\nIn the end, I don't believe in God because the concept of God is too vague to be taken seriously. I prefer to live my life based on the principles of reason, compassion, and justice, rather than relying on the supposed will of an inscrutable deity."}

Secondly, the reference to 'coming to their rescue' suggests that the speaker felt that the other person should have helped them in some way, but did not. Finally, the use of the word 'rescue'suggests that the speaker was in some kind of dangerous or dire situation that required intervention.

It's not just about being politically correct or correcting others, it's about creating a more inclusive and respectful society for all.\n\nIt's time for more women to speak out against these types of statements, and for the media and political figures to hold themselves accountable for the language they use. We all have a responsibility to create a more inclusive and respectful society."}
