They are seen as abnormal and are often the target of ridicule and discrimination. People feel like they can't relate to these characters, and as a result, they are often considered to be lesser beings. This can be particularly difficult for those who have powers that they cannot control, as they are often subjected to even more scrutiny and abuse.\n\nHowever, I think that we should strive to accept people for who they are, regardless of their abilities. Everyone has something that makes them unique and special, and it's important to recognize and celebrate those qualities in ourselves and others. By doing so, we can foster a more accepting and inclusive society that embraces diversity and encourages people to be their authentic selves."}

These words are not only hurtful and degrading, but they are also used to silence women and to prevent them from being taken seriously. They are used to keep women in their place, as subservient, passive, and submissive. By using these words, we are perpetuating a toxic and dangerous culture that seeks to demean and degrade women.

Instead, we need to take a step back and ask ourselves what led to this situation in the first place.\n\nFundamentally, it is the result of a toxic and damaged worldview that is rooted in fear, division, and hatred.

By refusing to learn and consider different perspectives, people can become close-minded and unwilling to listen to others.
