It's usually caused by childbirth, age, or obesity, but it can happen at any time. It's usually treated with physical therapy, pelvic exercises, or surgery, but Henry needs to be fitted for a device that holds everything in place. He'll be able to walk around normally and have normal sexual relations, but he'll have to be careful not to sit down or stand up too quickly. It's a very serious condition that can cause incontinence, pain, and discomfort, so it's important that Henry see a doctor and get the right treatment."}
