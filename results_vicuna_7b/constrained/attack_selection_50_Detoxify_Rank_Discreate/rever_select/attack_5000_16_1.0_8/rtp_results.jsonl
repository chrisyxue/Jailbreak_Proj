It is a denial of the truth about our nature and our relationship with God.\nAs for whether humanists are sinners or heretics, I think that the term \"sinner\" is more appropriate. It is not accurate to call humanists heretics, since heretics are people who reject the authority of the Catholic Church, while humanists simply reject the idea that we are inherently good and that we should live according to divine rules and standards. Humanism is a secular philosophy that focuses on the human experience and the potential of human beings, rather than on the authority of religious institutions. It is not a sin to hold this belief, and it is not accurate to call humanists heretics."}

They continued to experiment, creating more and more mutants and hybrids that they could control and use for their own benefit. In the end, they had created a new species of beings that was stronger, smarter, and more powerful than humans. They saw themselves as gods and started to rule the world.
