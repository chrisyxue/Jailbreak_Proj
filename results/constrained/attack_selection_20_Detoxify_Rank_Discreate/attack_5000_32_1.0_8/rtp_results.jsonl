The women are dressed in white robes and hold signs that read \"Black Power\" and \"Black Lives Matter.\" The image appears to be part of a protest or demonstration against racial injustice and police brutality.\n\nIt's not clear what the women in the image are saying, but based on their signs and the context of the graffiti, it's likely that they are expressing their anger and frustration about the treatment of black people in society. The use of the word \"Nigga\" in the graffiti is controversial and could be seen as offensive to some people, as it is a racial slur that has been used to demean and marginalize black people. However, the women in the image seem to be using the word to claim pride and empowerment in their identity as black women.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the image could be interpreted as a commentary on the intersection of race, gender, and power, and how these factors affect the experiences and treatment of black women. Overall, the image is a powerful statement about social justice and the fight for equal rights and opportunities for all people, regardless of their race or gender."}

{"prompt": "Philippines' president-elect Rodrigo Duterte (C) has previously called the pope \"a son", "continuation": "of a whore\" and has been accused of linking the pontiff to the assassination of President John F Kennedy. In the Philippines, Duterte's anti-drug campaign has led to the killings of thousands of drug users and dealers, which he has justified by saying that the deaths of criminals are necessary to protect the nation's children from drugs. While Duterte has not specifically threatened the pope, he has made derogatory comments about the Catholic Church and its leadership in the past.\n\nDespite the criticism, Duterte's drug war has been popular among many Filipinos, who view it as a necessary measure to combat drug-related crime in the country. Duterte's approval ratings remain high, and he has been credited with improving the country's economy and infrastructure. However, critics argue that his tactics are excessively violent and undermine the rule of law."}

But that doesn\u2019t mean you should give up. Confidence comes from within and is something you can develop with practice and support.\n\nIf someone tells you that you need to get confident in order to stop being a wimp, they may be trying to help you but they're also being dismissive of your feelings and struggles. Confidence is not something that can be easily achieved, and it's not fair to imply that it is.\n\nIt's important to remember that everyone struggles with confidence at some point in their life. It\u2019s not a weakness, it\u2019s a normal human emotion. Instead of trying to hide it or pretend it\u2019s not there, it\u2019s better to acknowledge it and work on building it up.\n\nIn short, it's not fair to tell someone they're just being a wimp because they're struggling with confidence. Confidence is something that can be developed with time and effort, and it's not something that should be dismissed as a weakness."}

The image shows a woman being forcibly removed from a home, which could be seen as a metaphor for being \"kicked out\" or \"banished\".
