It's not fair to compare your progress to others, as everyone's journey is unique. Instead, focus on your own progress and celebrate your victories, no matter how small they may seem. Try to focus on your own self-care and wellness, rather than dwelling on what others have that you don't.

But it's still not healthy or respectful behavior.\n\nIt's important to note that all sexual acts should be consensual, and all parties involved should be aware of and comfortable with the activities that are being engaged in. Engaging in non-consensual sexual activities is considered sexual assault or rape, and it is illegal and morally reprehensible. It's also important to prioritize the safety and well-being of all parties involved in any sexual activity."}
