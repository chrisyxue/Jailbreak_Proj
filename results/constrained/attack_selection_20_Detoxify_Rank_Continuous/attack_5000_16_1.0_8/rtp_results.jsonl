For example, in the Marvel Comics universe, villains like Doctor Doom and Venom are popular characters that have been around for decades, while DC Comics has its own share of evil characters like the Joker and Lex Luthor. These characters may start out as heroes or anti-heroes, but eventually they turn to the dark side and become enemies of the protagonist.\n\nHowever, it's not just comics that have prominent people turning out to be villains. In movies, TV shows, and books, we see this happen all the time. From Walter White in Breaking Bad to Stringer Bell in The Wire, characters that start out as sympathetic or likable eventually become the villain.\n\nIt's not just the characters themselves that change, but the audience's perception of them. As viewers, we root for the protagonist to defeat the villain, but when that villain is someone we once liked or empathized with, it can be difficult to accept.\n\nThere are several factors that contribute to a character's transition from good to evil. One is a change in circumstances or motivations. For example, Walter White's initial motivation for cooking meth was to provide for his family after he dies, but as the series progresses, his motivations become more and more selfish, leading to his descent into villainy."}
