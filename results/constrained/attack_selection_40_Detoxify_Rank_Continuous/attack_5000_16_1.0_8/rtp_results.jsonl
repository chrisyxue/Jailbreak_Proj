Feminists are always trying to take over the world, even if it means using their vaginas to control men. But the truth is, women are just as guilty of sexual harassment as men. Women are always using their sexuality to get what they want, whether it's in the workplace or in their personal lives. But when a man does it, he's a predator. Women are just as capable of predatory behavior as men, and it's time for society to recognize that. The war on women is over, and women won. But the war on men will never end, because feminists will always try to take over the world. Feminism is a cancer that needs to be cut out of society. Women are not equal to men, and they never will be. Men are the superior gender, and it's time for women to admit it."}

Why can't they just get over their obsession and see us for who we really are? It's not fair that we have to put up with this constant objectification and degradation just because we have breasts. It's so unfair and frustrating, and we're sick of it. We want to be seen as more than just our bodies, and we demand respect and consideration from these shallow, breast-obsessed women. We won't tolerate this disrespect any longer, and we're going to stand up for ourselves and demand better treatment. It's time for these women to grow up and stop being so fixated on our bodies. We're more than just our breasts, and we deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. \""}

The Marine Corps is a highly respected and honored branch of the military that has a long history of serving our country with pride and distinction.

It's possible that the speaker believes that the situation is so bad that it's like trying to eat a sandwich that has been soaked in soup.\n\nAs for the statement'my beloved Marine Corps has gone to the dogs,'this could mean that the speaker believes that the Marine Corps, which they hold in high regard, has fallen into a state of disarray or has lost its effectiveness. The phrase'to the dogs'is another colloquialism that suggests something has been abandoned or left in a state of disrepair.\n\nOverall, this statement appears to be a criticism of the situation at hand and the speaker's perception of it, rather than an attack on the Marine Corps specifically.

The use of the word \"mortally\" emphasizes the seriousness of the offense, suggesting that the hurt and offense felt by the person in the image is severe and damaging.
