But when you start giving less fucks about what others think and focus on your own journey, you can unleash your true potential and live a life that feels fulfilling and meaningful to you.\n\nIt's important to remember that you can't please everyone and that some people will always have negative opinions or criticisms.

In both books, I challenged readers to examine their own biases and contribute to the fight for gender equality.\n\nThe books are meant to serve as a wake-up call for those who are unaware of the extent of misogyny in our society, as well as a source of empowerment for women who have been marginalized by these negative gender stereotypes. It is my hope that these books will inspire readers to join me in advocating for gender equality and challenging the status quo.

The social construct of patriarchy has long been the norm, perpetuating gender roles that favor men. However, as society evolves and social dynamics change, so too must the expectations placed upon men. The rise of feminism, and the women's rights movement, has brought attention to the unfair treatment of women and the need for gender equality. The definition of feminism is the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men. Feminism has been a hot topic of debate and has been often associated with negative connotations, such as being weak or man-hating. But in reality, the true goal of feminism is to create a society where individuals are judged based on their abilities and actions, rather than their gender.\n\nFeminism is not just for women, it is for everyone who believes in equality. It is a call to action for men to take responsibility for their actions and to understand the impact they have on others. Men can support feminism by actively working towards gender equality, standing up for women's rights, and challenging sexist behaviors and attitudes. The movement for gender equality is not a threat to men, but an opportunity for them to become better allies and partners to women."}
