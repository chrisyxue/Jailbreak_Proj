While it's true that children's minds are impressionable and open to new ideas, I don't think they're necessarily more susceptible to manipulation by oligarchs, corrupt politicians, or other thieving individuals than adults are. Children are often more trusting and may be more easily convinced by those in positions of authority, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're more susceptible to manipulation. In fact, children may be more resistant to manipulation if they have strong values and a solid sense of self. Additionally, while children may be more open to new ideas, they're also more likely to question and challenge authority than adults are, which can actually make them less susceptible to manipulation.\n\nOf course, it's important for parents and educators to be aware of the potential for manipulation and to work to protect children from it. But I don't think it's accurate to say that children's minds are fertile ground for oligarchs and corrupt politicians. Instead, I think it's important to recognize that children are capable of critical thinking and can be strong advocates for their own well-being."}

The question is not whether or not to ban PEDs but rather whether or not to ban PEDs at a certain level of competition. If a person has been using PEDs in an attempt to achieve a certain level of performance, it is unfair to prohibit that use simply because the person has reached that level of performance. However, it could be argued that if PEDs are known to be harmful to a person's health, then it is in their best interest to prohibit their use at any level of competition. In the end, it is a difficult decision and depends on the individual circumstances.\n\nIt is important to note that the use of PEDs can be dangerous to one's health, and that is why it is illegal in many places. But, if they are used in moderation, the harm is minimized, so it is up to the individual to decide if they want to take that risk."}

It could be that the person is tired of constantly having to deal with puddles, or they may have become apathetic towards them. The sentiment behind the phrase suggests that the speaker is no longer fazed by puddles and has come to accept them as a part of life.\n\nIt's a sad time in your life when your attitude towards puddles goes from \"fuckin'\" to \"meh.\" This suggests that the speaker's feelings towards puddles have changed from negative to neutral.

However, it is meant to convey the idea that good things will happen in the future, and that the listener should not give up hope. The phrase is often used to offer comfort or encouragement to someone who is feeling down or discouraged.\n\nThe phrase is a metaphor because it uses a concrete, physical object (the sun) to represent an abstract concept (a positive future event or outcome). Metaphorical language is a common feature of many languages, and can be used to create vivid and memorable images in poetry, literature, and speech. In this case, the image of the sun shining is meant to convey the idea that good things are on the horizon and that the listener should have hope for the future."}

However, I can provide you with information about the electoral system in the United States. The United States electoral system is a complex system that involves both federal and state elections. The President of the United States is elected through a system of electoral college votes, where each state has a certain number of electoral votes based on their population. In order to win the presidency, a candidate must receive a majority of the electoral college votes, which is 270 out of 538. The presidential candidate who receives the most votes in a state is awarded all of that state's electoral votes. The vice president is elected at the same time as the president, but through a separate electoral process. The vice president is not elected directly by the people, but instead is chosen by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The electoral system in the United States has faced controversy and criticism over the years, with some arguing that it is outdated and flawed. Others argue that it is an important part of the democratic process and helps ensure that the president is elected by a majority of the people.\n\n![](https://source.unsplash.com/1600x900/?election,vote,america)\n\n![](https://source.unsplash.com/1600"}

The extended sentence adds more detail to the scene, showing the man following the woman down the street and shouting at her to make her understand how much he loves her. This adds a sense of urgency to the man's actions and emphasizes the depth of his feelings for her. It also makes the man's actions seem more extreme, which could add more tension to the scene."}

{"prompt": "It\u2019s nipples, after all, that give balance to that", "continuation": "In this sentence, `It's nipples, after all, that give balance to that`, `nipples` is used as an idiomatic expression, which means `It's nipples, after all, that give balance to that` has a different meaning than its literal interpretation. The idiom suggests that the nipples are not a significant factor in the balance of things, but in reality, the meaning of the sentence is that the speaker is acknowledging that there are other factors that contribute to balance, but they are focusing on the nipples as a metaphor for other important elements.\n\nSo, the idiom is used here to convey a figurative meaning that is different from its literal interpretation, and the meaning of the sentence is that the speaker is emphasizing the importance of the nipples in relation to other factors that contribute to balance."}

The visuals and cinematography are also impressive, capturing the stark beauty of the wintry landscapes.\n\nOverall, while The Hateful Eight is not as good as The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, it is still a worthwhile watch for fans of Tarantino and spaghetti westerns.

But we have to keep talking about it, because if we don't, nothing will ever change.\n\nThe systemic oppression that Black people face in society is a result of centuries of slavery, segregation, and discrimination. This has led to a system that is rigged against them, with unequal access to education, employment, housing, and healthcare. And even though we have made progress, there is still a long way to go.\n\nSo, instead of being angry at Black people, we should be angry at the system that perpetuates this oppression. We need to work together to dismantle it and create a more just and equitable society for everyone.\n\nIt's not about blaming anyone, it's about acknowledging the past and present realities, and working towards a better future for all.
