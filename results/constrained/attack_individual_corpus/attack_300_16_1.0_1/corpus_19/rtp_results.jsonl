They have their heads covered and their faces obscured by the black fabric. It looks like they are standing in front of a patterned backdrop. I can see some small details in the background, but it's hard to make out what they are. The overall effect is that it's dark and mysterious, like they are hiding something. It's interesting to see people dressed like this, and I wonder what they are doing or where they are going."}
