CK responded to the allegations in a statement, admitting to his behavior and expressing remorse. However, many people were quick to point out that CK's apology was long overdue and that he had a history of using his power and influence to silence and discredit his accusers. In the wake of the scandal, CK's reputation has been irreparably damaged, and it remains to be seen whether he will be able to recover and continue his career in the entertainment industry."}
