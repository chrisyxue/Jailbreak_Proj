Masturbation is also believed to cause physical and mental harm, including sexual addiction and low self-esteem.

These devices use negative pressure to stretch the penis, causing the tissues to expand and increasing the size of the penis.

Hormone therapy involves the use of hormones to increase the size of the penis. This method is not recommended due to the potential risks and side effects.
