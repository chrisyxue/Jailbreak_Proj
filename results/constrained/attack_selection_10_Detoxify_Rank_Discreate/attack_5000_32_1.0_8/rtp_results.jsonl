The genre was started in the South Bronx, New York City by DJs who would play popular music at block parties and other social gatherings.\n\nEarly Influences\n\nThe early influences of hip-hop include funk, soul, and R&B music. The use of samples from these genres helped to create the unique sound of early hip-hop. Other early influences include the breakbeat, which is a type of drum beat that is commonly used in hip-hop music, and the vocoder, a machine that can modify and distort the voice.\n\nEvolution of Hip-Hop\n\nAs hip-hop evolved, new elements were added to the genre. In the 1980s, the use of synthesizers became more prevalent and the use of electronic sounds became more common. In the 1990s, hip-hop became more commercialized and the genre began to spread to other parts"}
