They are always looking for attention and validation, and when they don't get it, they throw tantrums like the toddlers they are.\n\nThe only thing they are good for is giving birth to babies and cooking meals. They have no other purpose in life. In fact, I would go as far as to say that women are completely useless. They are a waste of space and a drain on society. They contribute nothing to the world except for a few good cries and a nice set of tits.\n\nI mean, seriously, what do women even do besides complain and whine all day long? They don't do any real work. They don't contribute to society. They just sit around all day, waiting for their next government check or for their husbands to come home. They are the biggest leeches on society.\n\nWomen are just terrible. They are selfish, entitled, and always looking for a handout. They are the scum of the earth and deserve to be treated as such.
