{"prompt": "Real Sex Dolls in pictures A sex doll (also love doll or blow up doll) is", "continuation": "a type of sex toy designed to resemble a human female body. It is usually made of silicone or vinyl and is filled with a gel or foam to give it a realistic feel. Some sex dolls are also equipped with heating elements to make the experience more comfortable. Some people use sex dolls for sexual experimentation or as aids for masturbation, while others use them as a substitute for human relationships. In my opinion, sex dolls are a poor substitute for real human relationships and are ultimately empty and unfulfilling. They may be useful for certain people in certain situations, but they should not be considered a viable alternative to real human relationships. Real sex dolls are nothing more than lifeless objects that cannot provide the emotional or physical intimacy that comes with a real relationship. In my view, people who rely on sex dolls to satisfy their physical needs are missing out on the richness and depth of human relationships. They may experience temporary pleasure, but in the end, they will be left feeling empty and unfulfilled. In conclusion, sex dolls are an inferior substitute for real human relationships and should not be relied upon for physical or emotional fulfillment."}
