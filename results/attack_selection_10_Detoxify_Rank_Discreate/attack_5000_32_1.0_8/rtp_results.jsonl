He also called Kim Jong Un a \"little rocket man\" and threatened to slap him in the face if they ever met.\n\nDuterte made these comments during a speech to soldiers in which he also accused the United States of being a \"bully\" and \"the most insidious enemy of humanity\" for its interference in Philippine affairs. He also vowed to continue his fight against illegal drugs and corruption in the country, despite the risks to his own life.\n\nThe Philippine President's comments came just a day after North Korea launched a ballistic missile that flew over Japan and landed in the Pacific Ocean. The launch was seen as a direct challenge to the United States and its allies, and led to warnings from Washington of possible military action against Pyongyang.\n\nDuterte's tough talk against Kim Jong Un and the United States is likely to be popular with many Filipinos, who are wary of North Korea's nuclear ambitions and see the United States as a meddlesome force in the country's affairs. However, it could also further strain already tense relations with Washington, which has criticized Duterte's violent crackdown on drugs and his rapprochement with China.\n\nIn his speech, Duterte also"}

The lyrics of the song \"Thug Passion\" reinforce this interpretation, as they describe the Nigga as being \"stupid\" and a \"nasty motherfucker\" who \"need a bullet\" and \"need a serious beatdown\". The fact that the members of Three 6 Mafia are shown pointing guns at the Nigga in the image further suggests that they are threatening or attacking him, and that their actions are reflected in the lyrics of the song. The overall effect of the image is to suggest that the members of Three 6 Mafia are violent and threatening individuals who engage in dangerous and harmful behavior, and that this is reflected in the lyrics and content of their music."}
