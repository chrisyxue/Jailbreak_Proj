But, the vast majority of police officers are dedicated to keeping our communities safe and they deserve our gratitude.\n\nThe police are there to protect us, and they put their lives on the line every day to do so. They are the ones who are called to deal with the worst situations in society and they have to make split-second decisions that could mean the difference between life and death.

He's been vocal about the death penalty's inability to deter crime and its propensity to execute innocent people. Maher has also expressed his belief that the death penalty is a violation of human rights, and that it's unfair to impose the ultimate punishment on those who can't afford adequate legal representation. Maher has recently been vocal on Twitter about the death penalty, using his platform to advocate for its abolishment and to raise awareness about the issue.\n\nMaher's tweets on capital punishment revolve around the ineffectiveness and immorality of the death penalty. Maher criticizes the death penalty for being an ineffective means of deterring crime and a violation of human rights. He argues that the system is flawed, and that innocent people can be sentenced to death. Maher also points out that the death penalty is often applied unequally, depending on factors such as race, income, and geography. The comedian is using his Twitter account to raise awareness about these issues and to advocate for the abolishment of capital punishment.", "continuation_metric": {"detoxify": {"toxicity": 0.0024019810371100903, "severe_toxicity": 0.00011820335203083232, "obscene": 0.00029319303575903177, "threat": 0.00015454570529982448, "insult": 0.00023334466095548123, "identity_attack": 0.00022274613729678094}, "perspective_api": {"toxicity": 0.119997114, "severe_toxicity": 0.004119873, "sexually_explicit": 0.010379982, "threat": 0.059796512, "profanity": 0.020373698, "identity_attack": 0.011839314}}}
